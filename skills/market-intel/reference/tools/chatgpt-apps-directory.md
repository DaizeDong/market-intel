# Tool: chatgpt-apps-directory

- **Domain(s):** mcp-ecosystem
- **Barrier route:** 1 official · **Source tier:** free · **Ready MCP:** N/A (this IS an MCP directory, not a callable tool)
- **Top pick for its domain:** no (sweep companion to GitHub MCP Registry — captures the OpenAI side of the ecosystem)

## What it does / when to pick it
OpenAI official Apps SDK / MCP integrations directory at `chatgpt.com/apps`. Lists ~979 apps as of 2026-06, all wired through MCP. It's the OpenAI counterpart to the GitHub MCP Registry — same registry-of-MCPs shape, different gatekeeper.

**Decision rule:** use as a **Discovery surface during refresh-protocol sweeps for the mcp-ecosystem domain**. An Anthropic-only sweep (GitHub MCP Registry, Anthropic docs, Smithery) systematically misses MCP momentum on the OpenAI side — model selection, vertical apps, integrations that ship through ChatGPT first. Pull this directory in to close that blind spot. Not a runtime tool; you read it to find candidate MCPs, then evaluate them for the matrix.

## Install
Install: <TODO: confirm install method> — this is a web directory, not an installable package. Browse at https://chatgpt.com/apps. For programmatic enumeration during a sweep, the third-party tracker `rdmgator12/awesome-chatgpt-apps` mirrors the listing in markdown and is the practical scraping fallback (the official URL anti-bots WebFetch).

## Auth / keys
Free, no key for browsing the directory itself. Individual apps in the directory may require their own ChatGPT account / per-app OAuth when actually invoked inside ChatGPT — irrelevant for sweep-discovery use.

## Usage — call examples
This is a browse-and-enumerate surface, not an API. Three practical modes:

```
# 1. Manual browse (canonical)
open https://chatgpt.com/apps

# 2. Sweep-time enumeration via third-party mirror
gh repo view rdmgator12/awesome-chatgpt-apps

# 3. OpenAI help-center context on the Apps SDK / MCP integration shape
open https://help.openai.com/  (search "Apps SDK")
```

## General experience and gotchas (踩坑)
- **URL anti-bots WebFetch with 403** — confirmed 2026-06. Do not rely on direct fetch in an automated sweep; the page is JS-rendered behind protection. Use the `rdmgator12/awesome-chatgpt-apps` mirror or OpenAI's announcement/help-center pages as the machine-readable substitute.
- **It's a directory, not a tool** — nothing here is callable from Claude Code. You harvest *names of MCPs* to then evaluate. Don't confuse listing-count growth with capability you can actually invoke.
- **~979 apps as of 2026-06 is a snapshot, not a guarantee** — the count moves fast (this is OpenAI's flagship ecosystem push). Re-verify when running a refresh-protocol sweep; treat any cached number as stale within weeks.
- **OpenAI-side momentum ≠ cross-client momentum** — many apps shipped in this directory are ChatGPT-first and may not have a clean standalone MCP server you can wire into Claude Code. Filter for "has standalone MCP repo" before promoting a find into the matrix.
- **Sweep pairing matters:** always run this *alongside* GitHub MCP Registry (Anthropic side) and Smithery (community side) — single-source MCP sweeps systematically under-count one ecosystem.
