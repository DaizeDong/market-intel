# Tool: browserbase/stagehand

- **Domain(s):** browser-automation (also: none)
- **Barrier route:** ④ · **Source tier:** L2 · **Ready MCP:** no (TypeScript lib over Playwright; wrap it yourself)
- **Cost:** free (open source). LLM tokens for `act`/`extract`/`observe` calls + optional Browserbase hosting fee if you run on their cloud (self-host on your own Chromium is free).
- **Repo / Provider:** github.com/browserbase/stagehand, `browserbase/stagehand (23.0k★, gh-api 2026-06)`, MIT, pushed 2026-06
- **Top pick for its domain:** no

## What it does / when to pick it
Adds three AI primitives, `act` (do this), `extract` (pull structured data with a schema), `observe` (find candidate actions), on top of Playwright in **TypeScript**. **Pick it over browser-use** when you want *precise, scriptable* AI control: deterministic Playwright code for the stable parts, AI only at the brittle steps, with Zod-typed extraction. Pick browser-use instead for fully autonomous NL goals; pick plain playwright MCP if you don't need any AI step. TS-only, skip it if your harness is Python (use browser-use/crawl4ai).

## Install
`npm i @browserbasehq/stagehand` (Node ≥18; runs on local Playwright Chromium by default, or set Browserbase env to use their hosted browser). Not an MCP, call from a TS script. See L1 line in `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md#browser-automation`. On Windows prefer running the Node script in a clean shell; HTTP-first guidance in `install-guide.md` doesn't apply (this is a lib, not a server).

## Model integration status
Stagehand's model-dependent act, extract and observe modes require setup. All model or external-agent work must use installed `llmcall`, inheriting its current routing, model, timeout and fallback policy. No supported adapter for this library is supplied or verified here. Before using these modes, verify an actual installed-version adapter and its tool-I/O contract; otherwise stop at setup. Do not instantiate a direct provider client or add a separate model/provider ladder.

Plain deterministic browser scraping or local PDF text extraction remains usable through a current-session verified non-model route. Keep resulting content, indexes, cookies, profiles, traces and exports in verified PRIVATE versioned DATA. Any hosted browser or target-site credentials belong in the approved PRIVATE credential store and must stay out of transcripts.

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
- **TypeScript-first.** The Python port lags the TS one, for Python pipelines prefer browser-use/crawl4ai rather than fighting the less-maintained Python path.
- **`extract` with a Zod schema is the strong point**, typed output beats free-text scraping. But every `act`/`extract`/`observe` is an LLM call; cost scales with how many AI steps you keep. Script the deterministic steps in raw Playwright and reserve AI for the brittle ones.
- **Browserbase cloud ≠ free.** Default LOCAL mode is free on your own Chromium; only opt into Browserbase when you need their managed/stealth browser fleet (separate billing).
- **Same anti-bot ceiling** as Playwright underneath, hardened Cloudflare/DataDome still blocks LOCAL mode (Browserbase adds some stealth). Signal: CAPTCHA/403/empty extract. Escalate to patchright/nodriver/camoufox or Bright Data ②.
- Pin the version (23k★, near-daily pushes); the `act/extract/observe` API and config keys have shifted across releases.

## Failure signals & fallback
Failed = `extract` returns empty/garbage against the schema, `act` can't locate the element, CAPTCHA/403. Fallbacks: **browser-use** (autonomous goal), **playwright MCP** (deterministic script), **crawl4ai** (bulk + anti-bot), or **Bright Data ②** for the hard barrier.
