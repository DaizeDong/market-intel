# Tool: stefanoamorelli/sec-edgar-mcp

- **Domain(s):** finance-markets (also: none)
- **Barrier route:** ① free official · **Source tier:** L1 · **Ready MCP:** yes (stdio, `uvx`/Docker — no key, only a User-Agent string)
- **Cost:** free, no key, no quota (SEC EDGAR is a public US-gov data source; fair-access ~10 req/s)
- **Repo / Provider:** github.com/stefanoamorelli/sec-edgar-mcp — `stefanoamorelli/sec-edgar-mcp (313★, gh-api 2026-06)`; active (pushed 2026-06-05, not archived, AGPL-3.0)
- **Top pick for its domain:** yes (half of the free-start default: SEC EDGAR + FRED + Finnhub free tier)

## What it does / when to pick it
Wraps the SEC EDGAR system: 13M+ filings, full-text 10-K / 10-Q / 8-K, XBRL financial facts, and insider (Form 4) transactions — institutional-grade primary-source data at zero cost. **Decision rule:** this is the FIRST tool to reach for any US-company fundamentals, earnings, filing, or insider-trade question. Pick it over Finnhub/FMP/Polygon whenever the answer lives in an SEC filing (revenue/segments from the 10-K, risk factors, exec compensation, insider buys) — those are the canonical numbers and the source is free and authoritative. Reach for the priced siblings only for live quotes, macro series, or pre-parsed valuation ratios it doesn't compute.

## Install
stdio MCP via `uvx` (or Docker). The AGPL repo requires a `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT` env (SEC mandates a contact string like `"Name email@domain"`). Exact, time-stamped command: `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md → finance-markets`. L0 mechanics (stdio is flaky on Windows — prefer absolute paths, test in a plain shell first): `reference/install-guide.md`. Restart / `/mcp` reconnect after adding.

## Auth / keys
No API key. The only requirement is a valid **User-Agent** identifying you to the SEC (a name + email); requests without it get throttled/blocked by EDGAR. No secret involved, so the secret-hygiene rules don't apply here — set the User-Agent in the env and you're done.

## Usage — call examples
MCP tools cover company lookup (by ticker/CIK), filing retrieval, XBRL financial-fact extraction, and insider transactions. Minimal: resolve a ticker to its CIK, pull the latest 10-K, then extract a specific XBRL concept (e.g. `Revenues`, `NetIncomeLoss`) rather than dumping the whole filing.

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
- **Zero cost, institutional-grade — start here (shard).** It is the canonical source for US fundamentals; don't pay a vendor for numbers that are free and authoritative in the filing.
- **US-only.** EDGAR covers SEC registrants — no coverage for non-US-listed companies (use the company's home-market regulator or a paid global vendor for those).
- **Set the User-Agent or you get blocked.** SEC fair-access enforces it; a missing/garbage UA throttles you fast.
- **XBRL tags vary by filer/era.** The same economic line can sit under different us-gaap concepts across companies and years — confirm the tag you pulled actually maps to the metric you want; don't assume one tag fits all.
- **Filings are large and verbose.** Extract the specific section/XBRL fact you need; pulling whole 10-Ks burns context for little gain.
- **AGPL-3.0** — fine for internal research; relevant only if you redistribute a modified server.

## Failure signals & fallback
Failure looks like: empty result for a ticker (likely non-US / wrong CIK), EDGAR throttling (missing User-Agent), or a missing XBRL concept. **Fallbacks:** pre-parsed financials/valuation ratios → **Financial Modeling Prep** (`fmp`, free 250/day) or **Finnhub** (free 60/min); macro/economic context → **FRED MCP**; live quotes/history → **Polygon.io**.
