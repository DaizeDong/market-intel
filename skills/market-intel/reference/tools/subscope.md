# Tool: dancolta/subscope

- **Domain(s):** reddit-community (also: none)
- **Barrier route:** ④ self-host (keyless public RSS) · **Source tier:** L4 · **Ready MCP:** no, ships as a **Claude Code plugin** (self-host), not a hosted MCP; runs locally
- **Cost:** free, no API key, no Reddit account; reads public RSS feeds, stores to local SQLite [https://github.com/dancolta/subscope, fetched 2026-06]
- **Repo / Provider:** github.com/dancolta/subscope, `dancolta/subscope (0.0k★, gh-api 2026-06 — 10 stars, thin adoption)`; not archived, MIT, pushed 2026-06 (active but very early)
- **Top pick for its domain:** no, a niche, post-GummySearch buyer-intent tool, thin adoption (10★)

## What it does / when to pick it
A free Claude Code plugin that surfaces **buyer-intent Reddit threads** with **no API key and no Reddit account**: it reads public RSS feeds, scores each post against 8 buying-signal patterns, and returns a ranked buyer-signal + authority-play list right in chat, persisting to local SQLite. **Decision rule:** pick it specifically for **lead-gen / buyer-intent monitoring**, "which Reddit threads right now show someone ready to buy / asking for a tool like ours", i.e. as an open-source **GummySearch / Syften / F5Bot alternative** (relevant because GummySearch shuts down 2026-11, per the shard "Watch"). It is **not** a general Reddit reader: for broad browse/search/post-details use **reddit-mcp-buddy**, and for *finding which subreddits* to monitor use **reddit-research-mcp**. Choose subscope only when the job is recurring buyer-signal scoring, and you want zero creds and local storage.

## Install
Self-host Claude Code plugin (Python), installed via the **plugin marketplace** (not a git-clone local MCP): per its README the flow is `/plugin marketplace add dancolta/subscope` then `/plugin install subscope@subscope`, followed by a mandatory `/subscope-onboard` first-run (then `/subscope-run` for scans), **unverified exact strings, confirm at github.com/dancolta/subscope** and `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md → reddit-community`. No key → nothing secret to leak on add. Because it runs locally with SQLite, it persists across sessions on your machine (no hosted dependency). On Windows, run the install in a plain shell first to confirm it starts; see `reference/install-guide.md` for self-host (route ④) mechanics. A newly added plugin needs a session restart / `/mcp` reconnect.

## Auth / keys
**None.** No API key, no Reddit login, it only reads **public RSS feeds**, so the secret-hygiene clipboard script does **not** apply. The flip side: RSS gives you only what Reddit exposes publicly (recent posts per feed), not authenticated-API breadth.

## Usage, call examples
As a plugin, you invoke it in chat to monitor a set of subreddits/feeds and get back a **ranked buyer-signal list** (posts scored by the 8 buying-intent patterns) plus suggested "authority-play" responses. Minimal: point it at the subreddit RSS feeds for your niche → run the scoring → review the top-ranked buyer-intent threads. Results land in local SQLite so you can re-query / dedupe across runs. List the exact plugin commands from its README after install, don't assume signatures from memory.

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
- **Very thin adoption (10★, pushed 2026-06).** It's early and lightly used, treat it as experimental: pin the commit you tested, and re-verify behavior before depending on it for a client deliverable.
- **RSS-only = limited window and no deep history.** Public RSS returns a shallow slice of recent posts per feed, not the full-API backfill GummySearch had, it's a *monitoring* tool (catch new buyer signals), not a historical-research tool.
- **The 8 buying-signal patterns are heuristics, not ground truth**, they'll surface false positives ("looking for recommendations" that never converts). Read the actual thread before treating a high score as a lead (CONSTITUTION C1, verify, don't trust the score).
- **No Reddit account = no rate-limit creds**, but RSS endpoints can still throttle if you poll many feeds aggressively, space out polling.
- Free and keyless, so per CONSTITUTION C2 it's a legitimate first try before any paid social-listening SaaS, just accept the shallow-RSS ceiling.

## Failure signals & fallback
Failure looks like: empty or stale buyer-signal lists (RSS feed too narrow or throttled, broaden the feed set / slow the poll), the plugin not loading on Windows (Python self-host path issue, test in a plain shell), or noisy false-positive "leads" (heuristic scoring, read threads to confirm). **Fallbacks:** for broad Reddit browse/search/post-details → **reddit-mcp-buddy** (official API); for semantic discovery of which subreddits to monitor → **reddit-research-mcp**; for paid cross-platform keyword monitoring → Syften (MCP) or free F5Bot; for comment-tree depth → **praw**.
