# Tool: omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper

- **Domain(s):** leadgen-crm (also: browser-automation)
- **Barrier route:** ④ · **Source tier:** L4 · **Ready MCP:** no (desktop GUI app + optional REST API; no MCP)
- **Cost:** free (200 searches/month, lifetime; each search returns 1000s of rows). REST-API tier also 200/mo free. [github.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper, fetched 2026-06]
- **Repo / Provider:** github.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper — `omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper (2.7k★, gh-api 2026-06)`, MIT, active (pushed 2026-06)
- **Top pick for its domain:** no (the ④ default is **gosom/google-maps-scraper** — lower-friction headless; pick omkarcloud when you need its 50+ fields / built-in email+social enrichment)

## What it does / when to pick it
Extracts Google Maps Business Profiles (local B2B leads) with **50+ fields** including emails, social
profiles, and decision-maker contacts — enrichment is built in, so it goes further than gosom's
name/phone/site/email. Built on the author's Botasaurus anti-detect browser. **Decision rule:** for
plain local-business leads default to **gosom/google-maps-scraper** (route ④, headless, scriptable,
lower risk). Reach for omkarcloud only when you specifically want its richer field set / one-step
email+socials enrichment and a click-to-run GUI is acceptable.

## Install
Not a pip library anymore — it ships as a **desktop GUI app**. Download the platform build (Win `.exe`,
Mac `.dmg`, Ubuntu `.deb`, Fedora `.rpm`) from the repo README, open it, type a search, press Run.
Requires Google Chrome installed. Windows: build is from an "unknown publisher" → Defender SmartScreen
will warn; allow it through the Firewall too. Headless/automation users want the separate REST
**Google Maps Extractor API** (omkar.cloud/tools/google-maps-extractor-api, 200/mo free) instead of the
GUI. See `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md` → leadgen-crm and `reference/install-guide.md` (L0
route-④ mechanics). No MCP, so nothing to add to `~/.claude.json`.

## Auth / keys
No login or API key for the GUI app (Google session handled by the bundled browser). The REST API tier
issues its own key from omkar.cloud — only that path is key-bearing.

## Usage — call examples
GUI: enter a keyword + location (e.g. "dentists in Austin"), Run, export CSV (name, phone, website,
email, socials, …). REST API path (if used): POST a search task to the omkar.cloud endpoint with your
key, poll for the CSV/JSON result. There is no MCP tool surface — drive it as an external app/REST call
and read the exported CSV into the research.

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
- **Far lower legal/ban risk than LinkedIn scraping** (shard compliance red line) — Google Maps public
  business data, not personal-profile cookie scraping. Still apply GDPR/CCPA delete-request handling to
  any captured personal email.
- **200 searches/month free cap** — each search yields many rows, so the cap is generous, but it is a
  monthly ceiling, not a one-time grant. Plan batches.
- **Email/decision-maker enrichment is best-effort** — many rows come back with blank email; treat the
  enrichment fields as bonus, not guaranteed, and verify hits with Hunter/ZeroBounce before outreach.
- **GUI-first is awkward for agent automation** — the desktop app is click-driven; for any scripted/
  repeatable run use the REST API or fall back to gosom (headless by design).
- Windows publisher-trust warning is expected, not malware; the underlying engine is Botasaurus.

## Failure signals & fallback
Fail signals: app blocked by SmartScreen/Firewall and never launches; runs return 0 rows or all-blank
emails; you hit the 200/mo cap. **Fallback:** **gosom/google-maps-scraper** (route ④, same domain,
headless, the shard default) for the leads themselves, then **Hunter.io** / **ZeroBounce** MCP to
find/verify the emails. For company intel at scale, **Bright Data** (free 5k/mo) absorbs the scraping
risk.
