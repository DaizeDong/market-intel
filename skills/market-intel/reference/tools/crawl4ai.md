# Tool: unclecode/crawl4ai

- **Domain(s):** browser-automation (also: web-scraping, trends-discovery)
- **Barrier route:** ③ · **Source tier:** L2 · **Ready MCP:** yes, docker MCP (also usable as a Python lib)
- **Cost:** free (open source, Apache-2.0). Self-host = zero API cost; LLM tokens only if you use the optional LLM-extraction strategy; proxies at scale.
- **Repo / Provider:** github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai, `unclecode/crawl4ai (81.8k★, gh-api 2026-09-06)`, Apache-2.0, pushed 2026-09-01
- **Top pick for its domain:** yes

## What it does / when to pick it
LLM-friendly crawler that renders pages and emits clean **Markdown / structured JSON** ready for an LLM, with **built-in anti-bot** (handles many Cloudflare/Akamai cases) at zero API cost. The zero-cost self-host crawl 首选. **Pick it over playwright MCP** for **bulk** crawling (many URLs, whole-site, or "fetch + clean to Markdown" pipelines) and when plain Playwright gets soft-blocked. Pick browser-use/stagehand instead for goal-driven interaction (login flows, clicking through a portal); crawl4ai is read/extract-oriented, not a click-the-buttons agent.

## Install
`pip install crawl4ai` then `crawl4ai-setup` (installs Playwright browsers), **or** run the Docker image which exposes a **ready MCP**, preferred for a clean, reproducible server (see `install-guide.md` Docker prereq). L1 line: `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md#browser-automation`. Docker/HTTP route is the Windows-friendly path (avoids native Playwright path quirks).

## Auth / keys
Crawl4AI's deterministic CSS/XPath/Markdown extraction needs no model key. Target cookies, headers, browser state, caches and extracted data still belong in a verified PRIVATE versioned runtime configured through the installed version's supported options. Any model-assisted extraction must use installed `llmcall` with its current routing and defaults. `LLMExtractionStrategy` remains setup-only until a compatible adapter and its extraction input/output contract have been verified; supplying a direct provider key does not satisfy this workflow.

## Usage, call examples
```python
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def read_markdown(crawler: AsyncWebCrawler):
    result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com/")
    return result.markdown
```
The caller supplies an initialized crawler whose browser/cache/output paths use the verified
PRIVATE runtime, then persists the returned Markdown through the private output adapter. Do not
construct a crawler with default persistence paths for real work. If a writer cannot be
redirected through the installed version's supported options, keep the integration in setup.
For structured output, prefer `JsonCssExtractionStrategy` or the installed version's XPath
strategy. For Docker MCP, discover the selected crawl operation in the active host and verify
its actual input/output shape with a read request. Upstream MCP support or a reachable container
is only a setup signal. Keep the model-assisted path in setup until the installed `llmcall`
adapter passes the same operation check.

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
- **Best free first hop for "fetch + clean to Markdown" at volume**, its anti-bot clears many soft Cloudflare/Akamai walls that stop plain Playwright, at zero per-request cost (unlike Firecrawl/Bright Data ②).
- **Prefer deterministic CSS/XPath/Markdown extraction.** Irregular structure may justify model assistance after the installed `llmcall` adapter and tool I/O are verified. Preserve routing, model, timeout and fallback defaults; do not create another provider ladder.
- **Not an interaction agent.** It reads/extracts; it won't reliably log in, click through paginated portals, or fill forms. For that use browser-use/stagehand/skyvern.
- **Hard anti-bot still wins.** Aggressive DataDome / per-request CAPTCHA / heavy JS-fingerprinting will still block it, signal: 403, challenge HTML in `.markdown`, empty result. Then add patchright/camoufox, or hand it to Bright Data ② (provider absorbs the barrier). For e-commerce price work specifically, prefer the e-commerce shard's picks (Keepa ①, Bright Data ②) over raw crawling, Amazon returns 500/blocks to generic crawlers.
- Proxies are the hidden cost at scale; the software is free.

## Failure signals & fallback
Failed = 403 / challenge page text in the markdown / empty result, or you actually need to click/log in. Fallbacks: **patchright/nodriver/camoufox** (fingerprint), **browser-use/stagehand** (interaction needed), **Firecrawl ② or Bright Data ②** (let a provider absorb the anti-bot barrier).
