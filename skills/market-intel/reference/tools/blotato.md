- **Top pick for its domain:** yes

## What it does / when to pick it
Managed multi-platform posting (~9 platforms) with a **native Claude Code MCP** — designed to be driven by an agent. **Decision rule:** pick Blotato when you want a **cheap, Claude-Code-native** posting MCP and are fine with a paid plan ($29/mo). It is the shard's "Claude Code native cheap" default. Choose **Buffer** instead when you want route ①/official + a genuine **free** tier; choose **Postiz** when you must self-host (OSS, no fee, no token storage). Note the real unit is **20 social accounts** at Starter — *not* "9 platforms" (correct the one-liner from tool-master).

## Install
Native Claude Code MCP — add per Blotato's docs with your API key (HTTP — **prefer on Windows**). Exact, time-stamped line: `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md → social-publishing` ("Blotato: Starter $29/mo = 20 social accounts, `backend.blotato.com/v2` + MCP (API key header; API needs a paid plan)"). A newly added MCP only works **after a session restart / `/mcp` reconnect**. L0 mechanics: `reference/install-guide.md`.

## Auth / keys
**API key passed as a header**; the API is gated behind a **paid plan** (free signup alone won't authorize API/MCP calls). Secret-hygiene (one line): never `browser_snapshot` the key page — user copies → clipboard → direct `~/.claude.json` header edit, not `claude mcp add` (which echoes the key); full procedure in `reference/install-guide.md`.

## Usage — call examples
```
POST https://backend.blotato.com/v2/posts
  blotato-api-key: <API_KEY>
  {"post":{"content":"hello","platform":"twitter","accountId":"<id>"}}
```
Via MCP: list connected accounts → call the post/schedule tool with content + target account ID. The native MCP surfaces these as Claude Code tools directly.

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
- **Quota is "20 social accounts", not "9 platforms"** (shard correction) — when sizing a job, count the user's connected *accounts*, not platform types.
- **API/MCP needs a paid plan** — a free account that "connected" in the UI will still 401/403 on API calls; verify the plan, not just the connection (this is a common silent failure).
- Endpoint base is `backend.blotato.com/v2` — older `/v1` references float around; use v2.
- X link-posts still cost $0.20 each at the platform level (shard cost trap) — Blotato does not absorb that.
- Native MCP means tools appear directly in Claude Code (no `mcp-remote` shim), which is its main edge over Buffer/Ayrshare for agent-driven runs — but it still won't connect without the paid-plan key.

## Failure signals & fallback
Failure looks like: 401/403 on the API despite a "connected" dashboard (= free plan, no API access), `! Needs authentication` in `claude mcp list`, or posting to the wrong account ID. **Fallbacks:** **Buffer** (route ①, free tier) when you don't want to pay; **Postiz** (OSS self-host) to drop the SaaS fee; for a single free platform skip the aggregator (Bluesky → atproto, Mastodon → Mastodon.py).
