# Tool: cullenwatson/StaffSpy

- **Domain(s):** leadgen-crm (also: none)
- **Barrier route:** ④ · **Source tier:** L4 · **Ready MCP:** no (Python library; self-host)
- **Cost:** free (open source). Hidden costs: a LinkedIn account (burned at risk) + optional CAPTCHA solver (CapSolver / 2Captcha, paid per solve). [github.com/cullenwatson/StaffSpy, fetched 2026-06]
- **Repo / Provider:** github.com/cullenwatson/StaffSpy — `cullenwatson/StaffSpy (255★, gh-api 2026-06)`, WTFPL, not archived but ⚠ last push 2025-06 (~12mo stale — LinkedIn DOM/anti-bot changes may have broken it; smoke-test before relying)
- **Top pick for its domain:** no (route-④ default is **gosom/google-maps-scraper** — LinkedIn scraping is the high-ban-rate path the shard tells you to avoid)

## What it does / when to pick it
A Python library that **fetches a company's staff roster from LinkedIn** — given a company + title +
location it returns employees in a Pandas DataFrame with skills, experiences, certifications, schools,
follower/connection counts, and a guessed `potential_email`. Also scrapes individual users by id, post
commenters, and your own connections' contact info. **Decision rule:** only pick StaffSpy when you
specifically need *who works at company X* and no compliant source covers it. For ordinary B2B leads
prefer **Apollo.io** (① find+enrich, no ban risk) or **gosom/google-maps-scraper** (④ low risk). This
is the LinkedIn-cookie route the shard flags at 25–35% ban rate.

## Install
```
pip install -U "staffspy[browser]"
```
Or latest from source: `pip install "git+https://github.com/cullenwatson/StaffSpy.git#egg=staffspy[browser]"`.
Python ≥ 3.10. Library only — no MCP server, nothing added to `~/.claude.json`. See
`reference/volatile/pricing-install.md` → leadgen-crm and `reference/install-guide.md` (route-④
self-host mechanics + throwaway-account/proxy note).

## Auth / keys
Needs a **logged-in LinkedIn session**: either pass `username`/`password`, or omit them and a browser
opens for a one-time manual sign-in (cookies saved to `session_file`, lasts ~a week). **Use a
throwaway/burner account — never the user's primary LinkedIn.** Optional `solver_service`
(`SolverType.CAPSOLVER` / `2CAPTCHA`) + `solver_api_key` for CAPTCHA challenges (paid). Secret hygiene:
do not echo the LinkedIn password or solver key into the transcript; have the USER supply them — see
`reference/install-guide.md` (secret-handling).

## Usage — call examples
```python
from staffspy import LinkedInAccount
account = LinkedInAccount(session_file="session.pkl", log_level=1)
staff = account.scrape_staff(company_name="openai", search_term="software engineer",
                             location="london", extra_profile_data=True, max_results=50)  # up to 1000
staff.to_csv("staff.csv", index=False)
```
Other entry points: `scrape_users([...ids])`, `scrape_comments([post_ids])`, `scrape_companies([...])`,
`scrape_connections()`.

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
- **⚠ HIGHEST-ban-risk route** — LinkedIn cookie-scraping = 25–35% account ban rate (shard compliance
  red line). Burner account only; **small batches** (`max_results` defaults low for a reason — pushing
  toward 1000 invites detection/throttling). The `block=True`/`connect=True` flags are account-altering
  side effects — leave them off unless intended.
- **Repo is ~12 months stale (last push 2025-06)** — LinkedIn changes its DOM and bot defenses often;
  expect possible breakage and verify a 1-row scrape works before any real run.
- **`potential_email` is GUESSED** (e.g. first.last@domain permutations), not verified — always pass
  through **Hunter.io** / **ZeroBounce** before outreach, or you'll bounce and burn sender reputation.
- CAPTCHA walls appear under load → without a configured solver the run silently stalls/returns partial.
- **GDPR/CCPA:** this is personal data of identified individuals — the strictest delete-request /
  lawful-basis obligations apply. The shard says: prefer Google Maps leads or Bright Data when possible.

## Failure signals & fallback
Fail signals: login loop / CAPTCHA wall with no solver; account checkpoint or ban; empty DataFrame or
all-blank fields (DOM drift on the stale code); throttled after a large `max_results`. **Fallback (in
shard order):** **Apollo.io** ① for find+enrich (compliant, no ban) → **gosom/google-maps-scraper** ④
for low-risk local leads → **Bright Data** ② (free 5k/mo, scrapes off their account, legally defended)
for company/people intel without burning your own account.
