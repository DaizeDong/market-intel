# Tool: Sensor Tower MCP

- **Domain(s):** trends-discovery (also: none)
- **Barrier route:** ② resale/official API · **Source tier:** L2 · **Ready MCP:** yes — needs a Sensor Tower (ST) token
- **Cost:** paid, price unverified 2026-06 — pricing is **gated (contact-sales, no public free tier)**; confirm at https://sensortower.com/pricing ("We customize pricing plans for each customer — get in touch"). Historically an enterprise-grade subscription; budget accordingly.
- **Repo / Provider:** https://sensortower.com (official provider; non-GitHub)
- **Top pick for its domain:** no

## What it does / when to pick it
Sensor Tower is the market-leading source for **mobile app download & revenue ESTIMATES** (plus advertising/usage intelligence) across App Store and Google Play. **Pick it only when the question genuinely needs estimated installs/revenue or competitive download trends** — e.g. "how much is competitor X's app earning", "is this category's downloads growing". For everything you can get from public store metadata (rankings, reviews, ratings, descriptions), do NOT pay — use the free ③ route first. This is the paid escape hatch for the one thing the free tools cannot estimate.

## Install
HTTP/MCP per Sensor Tower's docs once you have a token. Conceptually:
```
claude mcp add --transport http -s user sensor-tower <ST_MCP_URL> --header "Authorization: Bearer <ST_TOKEN>"
```
Confirm the exact endpoint + transport in the ST dashboard / their MCP docs (URL not pinned here because it is behind the paid account). Prefer HTTP transport on Windows. L1 line: `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md` → trends-discovery ("Sensor Tower MCP: connected + ST token, needs pricey ST sub"). MCP only takes effect after session restart / `/mcp` reconnect.

## Auth / keys
Token comes from your paid Sensor Tower account/dashboard. **Secret hygiene (key-bearing):** never `browser_snapshot` the page that shows the token; have the user copy it and edit `~/.claude.json` headers from clipboard rather than `claude mcp add` (which echoes the key into the transcript). One line + see `reference/install-guide.md` (Secret-handling hygiene).

## Usage — call examples
After connecting, ST exposes tools for app metadata, category rankings, and download/revenue estimates. Typical flow: resolve the app id → query estimated downloads/revenue over a date range for a country. (Exact tool names/params come from the connected ST MCP — list them after connecting; treat estimate fields as modeled, not ground truth.)

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
- **It is an ESTIMATE engine, not ground truth.** Downloads/revenue are modeled; cross-check magnitude against store rankings before quoting a hard number.
- **Cost is the gate.** No public free tier — every use burns a pricey subscription. The shard explicitly tags it "needs pricey ST sub"; reach for it ONLY when free routes can't answer (CONSTITUTION C2: prefer free ④/③).
- **For raw store metadata it is overkill** — rankings/reviews/ratings are free via `mobile-store-scraper-mcp` or the npm scrapers. Paying ST for those is a cost trap.
- **Pricing rot:** because pricing is sales-gated, never assert a dollar figure from memory — point the user at the pricing page.

## Failure signals & fallback
Failure = `! Needs authentication` / `✗ Failed` in `claude mcp list` (bad/expired token), or 401/403 at call time. **Fall back to** the free metadata route: `mobile-store-scraper-mcp.md` (both stores, no key) or `facundoolano/google-play-scraper` + `app-store-scraper` for rankings/reviews/ratings — accepting you lose the download/revenue ESTIMATES, which no free tool reproduces. For trend/launch discovery generally, the domain defaults are GDELT MCP + Product Hunt MCP + Trends MCP.
