# Tool: CoinMarketCap MCP

- **Domain(s):** crypto-defi (also: none)
- **Barrier route:** ① official · **Source tier:** L1 · **Ready MCP:** yes — official, needs free key
- **Cost:** free — Basic tier **50 calls/min · 15k call credits/mo** [https://coinmarketcap.com/api/pricing/, fetched 2026-06]. Cheapest paid: Hobbyist $29/mo ($348/yr). Also offers x402 pay-per-call.
- **Repo / Provider:** https://coinmarketcap.com (official CMC MCP / Pro API)
- **Top pick for its domain:** no

## What it does / when to pick it
Quotes, technical-analysis indicators, derivatives data, and **market narratives/categories** over the CoinMarketCap Pro dataset. **Decision rule:** pick CMC when you specifically need its narrative/category framing, derivatives quotes, or TA indicators — i.e. when CoinGecko's plain price/market data isn't enough. For routine read-only price/volume and on-chain DEX history, **CoinGecko MCP is the default** (keyless, higher free throughput). Treat CMC as the complementary "quotes + narratives" leg, not the first stop.

## Install
Official MCP, **needs a free Basic key** (bearer/header). Exact, time-stamped command + key form: `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md → crypto-defi` and the shard line ("free Basic now 50/min + 15k credits/mo; x402 pay-per-call"). Prefer HTTP transport on Windows. L0 mechanics: `reference/install-guide.md`. Restart / `/mcp` reconnect after adding.

## Auth / keys
Free Basic key from the CoinMarketCap Pro dashboard (pro.coinmarketcap.com → API key). **Secret hygiene (key-bearing):** USER supplies the key; never echo it; edit `~/.claude.json` directly from clipboard rather than `claude mcp add` (which echoes the header/URL with the key), and never `browser_snapshot` the key page. One line + full rules: `reference/install-guide.md`.

## Usage — call examples
Tools cover latest quotes, listings, market metrics/categories, and (plan-gated) derivatives + TA. Minimal: pull the latest quote for a symbol, then list its category/narrative tags to frame which sector it sits in.

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
- **Credit-metered, not just rate-limited:** the **15k credits/mo** Basic cap is the real ceiling — many endpoints cost multiple credits per call, so a few wide listings calls can drain the month. Budget credits, don't just watch the 50/min.
- **Free Basic tier was bumped to 50/min (from 30/min)** — note any older skill text saying 30/min is stale.
- **Many endpoints are plan-gated:** historical, some derivatives, and advanced TA are paid-tier-only and return a `1006`/subscription error on Basic — that's an access gate, not "no data."
- **x402 pay-per-call** exists as an alternative to a subscription for occasional heavy calls — worth knowing before you upgrade a whole tier.
- Symbol collisions: prefer CMC's numeric `id` over ticker `symbol` to avoid pulling the wrong token.
- **Consumer site vs developer portal are SEPARATE account systems** (confirmed 2026-06) — `coinmarketcap.com` (the consumer dashboard, watchlists, etc.) and `pro.coinmarketcap.com` (the API developer portal where the key issues) require independent signups. The consumer site accepts `gmail.com` freely; the pro portal applies anti-abuse on signup ("The email is restricted for this action") and on password reset — sometimes you can recover by registering on the consumer site first then visiting the pro portal under the same browser session. Don't assume one credential works on both.

## Failure signals & fallback
Failure looks like: `1006`/subscription-required on a gated endpoint, HTTP 429 (50/min), or a monthly-credit-exhausted error. **Fallbacks:** routine price/volume + on-chain DEX history → **CoinGecko MCP** (keyless, default); on-chain address/tx/ABI → **Etherscan MCP** / **Blockscout MCP**; protocol TVL/yields/fees → **DefiLlama** REST; smart-money labels → **Nansen**.
