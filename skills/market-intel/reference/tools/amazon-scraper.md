# Tool: omkarcloud/amazon-scraper

- **Domain(s):** ecommerce-arbitrage (also: browser-automation)
- **Barrier route:** ④ browser / self-host · **Source tier:** L4 · **Ready MCP:** no (Python library / CLI; wrap it or call from your own script)
- **Cost:** free (self-host OSS, MIT; you pay only for your own runtime + proxies at scale)
- **Repo / Provider:** github.com/omkarcloud/amazon-scraper, `omkarcloud/amazon-scraper (0.2k★, gh-api 2026-06)`; active (220★, pushed 2026-04-30, not archived, **MIT**, gh-api 2026-06-09)
- **Top pick for its domain:** no (free live-data workhorse for Amazon; Keepa ① still owns history/BSR curves)

## What it does / when to pick it
Free Amazon scraper covering **24 Amazon sites** (.com/.co.uk/.de/.co.jp/…): search, product detail, and reviews, with a **built-in anti-detect browser** so you don't assemble your own stealth stack. **Decision rule:** pick it when you need current Amazon listing data (titles, prices, ratings, reviews) across regions at low/zero cost and don't need history, it's the Amazon-specialist of the free route. Choose **Keepa** ① instead for price/BSR/Buy-Box *history*; choose **Bright Data** ② when you want a provider to absorb the anti-bot barrier at scale instead of running the browser yourself; choose **Discount-Bandit** ④ when you want *ongoing* multi-store tracking rather than ad-hoc pulls.

## Install
`pip install` the package (it's a Python library, confirm the exact package/usage from the live repo README, as the entry point can change). It ships a built-in anti-detect browser, so first run may download a browser binary. Not an MCP, call it from a script and feed results to the agent, or wrap it. Prereqs (Python ≥3.10) & route-④ mechanics: `reference/install-guide.md`. Exact L1 line: `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md → ecommerce-arbitrage`. Verify the install/usage against the current README before running.

## Auth / keys
No API key for the scraper itself → **no secret-hygiene key concern**. At scale you'll supply your own **proxy pool** (Amazon anti-bot is strong; software is free, proxies aren't, shard). No Amazon account needed for public search/detail/review reads.

## Usage, call examples
Library/CLI, not MCP: call its search function with a query + Amazon domain to get a result list, then its product function on an ASIN/URL for detail + reviews. Minimal flow: search `"patio-heater outdoor heater"` on `amazon.com` → take top ASINs → fetch detail+reviews per ASIN → hand the structured rows to the agent for compare/sentiment. Exact function names: read them off the live README (UNVERIFIED here, keep C1/C5, don't assume the signature).

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
- **No history**, it returns the *current* snapshot only. For price/BSR/sales-rank *over time*, Keepa ① is irreplaceable; this tool can't backfill (shard).
- **Sales numbers are estimates**, any BSR→sales inference is approximate; cross-check, differences between tools can be multiples (shard).
- **Amazon anti-bot is strong**: the built-in anti-detect browser helps for modest volume, but high-rate or many-region scraping needs **proxies** or you'll get throttled/CAPTCHA'd. Budget the proxy pool as the real cost.
- Live-run framing (ecommerce shard / cross-domain note): for hardened e-commerce at scale, **Bright Data is the hard-data hero**, if this scraper starts returning HTTP 500 / CAPTCHA / empty pages, don't keep retrying the free browser; escalate to Bright Data's provider-side unlock.
- 24-site coverage is a real strength for **cross-region arbitrage** (compare .de vs .com vs .co.jp), but each locale has its own layout quirks; spot-check fields per domain rather than trusting one parser everywhere.
- MIT-licensed (gh-api 2026-06), clean to reuse/redistribute.

## Failure signals & fallback
Failure looks like: HTTP 500 / CAPTCHA / empty or stub product pages, missing fields, or rate-limit blocks. **Fallbacks (named):** hardened Amazon at scale → **Bright Data** (② Web Unlocker, the barrier-breaker); a one-off live read → **playwright MCP** (④); price *history* → **Keepa** (①); ongoing multi-store tracking → **Discount-Bandit** (④); real-time ASIN + Buy Box without self-hosting → **Rainforest API** (②).
