# Tool: subzeroid/instagrapi

- **Domain(s):** social-publishing (also: browser-automation)
- **Barrier route:** ③ · **Source tier:** L4 · **Ready MCP:** no (Python lib; wrap it yourself)
- **Cost:** free (OSS), your only cost is proxies + throwaway accounts at scale
- **Repo / Provider:** github.com/subzeroid/instagrapi, `subzeroid/instagrapi (6.3k★, gh-api 2026-06)` (MIT-style NOASSERTION; actively maintained, last push 2026-06)
- **Top pick for its domain:** no

## What it does / when to pick it
Most-active Instagram private-API client: **post photos/albums/Reels, comment, like, follow, send
DMs**, plus read profiles/media/stories. Pick it when the task is *writing* to Instagram (posting or
DMing) and there is no official-API path, it's the de-facto IG write tool. For **read-only** IG
(download posts/profiles/stories) prefer the lower-risk **instaloader** ③. For 小红书/抖音 use
xiaohongshu-mcp / MediaCrawler ④.

## Install
`pip install instagrapi` (Python ≥ 3.10). No ready MCP, call it from a small script or wrap as a
tool. Volatile line: `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md` → social-publishing / browser-automation.

## Auth / keys
Logs in with **real IG username + password** (and handles 2FA / challenge). Persist the session with
`cl.dump_settings()` / `cl.load_settings()` so you don't re-login every run (re-login spikes ban
risk). No API key. Have the user supply credentials through environment variables or approved
private configuration, with no transcript output. Credentials and sessions belong in a verified
PRIVATE versioned companion; private credential backups are allowed. See
`reference/install-guide.md` (Secret-handling hygiene).

## Usage, call examples
Make the full Market checkout importable. Initialize an existing `runtime/instagrapi` directory
under the configured PRIVATE companion data root and provide a fresh visibility receipt before
running this example. The shared resolver checks local Git configuration and the receipt; it does
not query GitHub live. Missing or unproven storage stops setup, with no source-tree fallback.

```python
import os
from instagrapi import Client
from tools.private_inventory import resolve_directory, resolve_destination

runtime = resolve_directory("runtime/instagrapi")
session = resolve_destination(path=runtime.path / "session.json")
cl = Client()
if session.path.exists():
    cl.load_settings(str(resolve_destination(path=session.path).path))
cl.login(os.environ["INSTAGRAM_USERNAME"], os.environ["INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD"])
cl.dump_settings(str(resolve_destination(path=session.path).path))
profile = cl.user_info_by_username(os.environ["INSTAGRAM_TARGET_USERNAME"])
```

This verifies only the selected read operation and session destination. Before launch, redirect
every other enabled SDK writer (downloads, caches and logs) through supported private paths;
session redirection alone does not prove the whole runtime is private. Keep setup-only if the
installed version cannot redirect a writer. Publishing is a separate, explicitly authorized
action, for example `cl.photo_upload(approved_private_image_path, approved_caption)`; never post
as an installation check.

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
- **Violates IG ToS, write/post is far more ban-prone than read.** Use a **throwaway account**, residential
  proxy, and human-like pacing; never run it on a real/valuable account (shard ④-route warning).
- **Reuse the saved session**, repeated fresh logins from a datacenter IP is the fastest way to a
  challenge/checkpoint/ban. Pin one device+proxy per account.
- IG silently shadow-limits: a call can "succeed" yet the post gets zero reach or is removed later,
  don't treat HTTP 200 as confirmed delivery.
- Private-API endpoints break when Instagram changes things; keep the lib updated (it's actively
  patched, which is exactly why it's the pick over staler IG libs).

## Failure signals & fallback
`LoginRequired` / `ChallengeRequired` / `PleaseWaitFewMinutes` = throttled or flagged → stop, rotate
account/proxy, back off. If writes are blocked, fall back to **playwright MCP** ④ (real logged-in
browser session) for the post, or drop to read-only **instaloader** ③ if you only need data.
