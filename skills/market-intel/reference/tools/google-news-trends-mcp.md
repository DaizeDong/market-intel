# Tool: jmanek/google-news-trends-mcp

- **Domain(s):** trends-discovery (also: none)
- **Barrier route:** ① official (free, no auth, self-host) · **Source tier:** L2 · **Ready MCP:** yes, self-host MCP server, no key (5 tools)
- **Cost:** free, no key, no quota (you pay only your own hosting) [https://github.com/jmanek/google-news-trends-mcp, fetched 2026-06]
- **Repo / Provider:** github.com/jmanek/google-news-trends-mcp, `jmanek/google-news-trends-mcp (81★, gh-api 2026-06)` (MIT; not archived; last push 2026-03-29)
- **Top pick for its domain:** no, GDELT/Trends MCP/Product Hunt lead; this is a free no-key complement for Google-native trending terms

## What it does / when to pick it
Self-host MCP (5 tools) that wraps **Google News RSS** (search/headlines/topics) plus **Google Trends trending keywords**, returning current trending search terms and the news articles around them. **Decision rule:** pick it to add *Google-native* trending keywords + headline context on top of **GDELT**, GDELT gives global multilingual tone/events, this gives you "what is Google trending right now and the stories behind it." Prefer **Trends MCP** when you need cross-platform acceleration with a clean growth-rate; prefer **SerpApi Google Trends** when you need reliable structured Trends JSON and don't mind the free 250/mo cap (confirmed `serpapi.com/pricing` 2026-06). Use this when free + no-key + Google-flavored trending is the priority.

## Install
Self-host: `git clone https://github.com/jmanek/google-news-trends-mcp` (or `uvx`/`pip` per its README), then register the local MCP server. Exact command lives in the volatile L1 line `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md → trends-discovery` (jmanek/google-news-trends-mcp, self-host, free no-key). No secret to leak, so `claude mcp add` is safe here. On Windows, stdio `uvx`/`pip` MCPs are flaky (path/shell), use absolute paths and test in a plain shell first. Restart / `/mcp` reconnect before use. L0 mechanics: `reference/install-guide.md`.

## Auth / keys
None. No API key, no account, no quota, the secret-hygiene script does **not** apply. It reads Google News RSS and the public Google Trends endpoints, so the only limits are Google's own throttling (see gotchas).

## Usage, call examples
After connecting, the 5 tools cover: search Google News by keyword, get top/topic headlines, and pull Google Trends trending keywords (optionally by geo). Typical flow: pull `trending keywords` for a region → for an interesting term, call the news-search tool to read the articles driving it → feed both into your report. List the exact tool names with your client after connecting, do not assume signatures from memory.

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
- **It rides Google's undocumented/unofficial endpoints** (News RSS + Trends), the same fragility class as the now-archived pytrends. Google can throttle (HTTP 429) or change response shape with no notice, a previously-working query can start returning empty/garbled. Verify a live call before trusting a run; add backoff for batches.
- **Google Trends values are relative (0 to 100 index), not absolute volume.** Good for "is this rising vs. its own baseline," useless for "how many people search this." For absolute volume use Google Ads Keyword Planner / DataForSEO.
- **RSS feeds are headline-level, not full text**, you get title/source/link/snippet; fetch the article separately (web-scraping shard) if you need body content.
- **Geo/locale matters**, trending terms are region-scoped; set the geo explicitly or you'll get US-default trends and misread a non-US market.
- **Single-author repo (81★, MIT).** It works and is recently maintained (push 2026-03), but it's thin, no SLA, breakage is yours to fix.
- **L1 free, route ①**, per CONSTITUTION C2, reach for it before any paid Trends source.

## Failure signals & fallback
Failure looks like: empty trending-keyword list or HTTP 429 from Google (throttled), or malformed parses after a Google response change. **Fallbacks:** for global multilingual news tone use **GDELT MCP** (free, no auth); for structured Google Trends JSON use **SerpApi Google Trends** (free 250/mo, confirmed `serpapi.com/pricing` 2026-06); for normalized cross-platform acceleration use **Trends MCP**; for the OSS Trends-only route use **flack0x/trendspyg / sdil87/trendspy** (browser-automation shard, post-pytrends).
