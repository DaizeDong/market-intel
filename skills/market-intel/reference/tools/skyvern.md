# Tool: Skyvern-AI/skyvern

- **Domain(s):** browser-automation (also: none)
- **Barrier route:** ④ · **Source tier:** L2 · **Ready MCP:** yes, self-host + API (run the Skyvern server, drive via its API/MCP)
- **Cost:** free (open source, AGPL-3.0) to self-host; LLM tokens for the vision/LLM planner + proxies at scale. A paid Skyvern Cloud also exists (separate billing).
- **Repo / Provider:** github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern, `Skyvern-AI/skyvern (21.9k★, gh-api 2026-06)`, AGPL-3.0, pushed 2026-06
- **Top pick for its domain:** no

## What it does / when to pick it
Uses an LLM **+ computer vision** to run whole browser *workflows* (multi-step forms, portals, dashboards) that stay robust when the **UI/layout changes**, it looks at the rendered page like a human rather than relying on brittle selectors. **Pick it over playwright/browser-use** when the target redesigns often or selectors keep breaking, or for repeatable form-filling/login workflows across many similar sites. Skip it for one-off reads or bulk static crawling (heavier to stand up than playwright MCP / crawl4ai).

## Install
Self-host: `git clone` the repo and run via Docker / `docker compose` (server + UI), then drive through its REST API or MCP. Needs Docker (see `install-guide.md` prereqs). Heavier setup than a one-line MCP, stand it up only when vision-robust workflows justify it. Exact compose steps live in the repo README; L1 pointer in `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md#browser-automation`. ⚠ **AGPL-3.0**, note the license before embedding in anything you redistribute.

## Model integration and private setup
The vision planner requires model integration. All model or external-agent work must use installed `llmcall`, inheriting its current routing, model, timeout and fallback policy. No supported Skyvern adapter is supplied or verified here. Before starting planner tasks, verify an actual installed-version adapter and its tool-I/O contract; otherwise stop at setup. Direct provider keys or a second routing ladder are not a substitute.

Resolve profiles, cookies, workflow state, traces and outputs to verified PRIVATE versioned DATA before starting the server. Target-site credentials and any hosted-service key belong in approved PRIVATE configuration and must not appear in transcripts. Confirm upstream persistence settings support these destinations; otherwise keep this route at setup.

## Usage, call examples
After the adapter and private persistence checks pass, inspect the installed server's OpenAPI or active-session MCP tool schema, then verify a bounded read-only workflow and its returned fields. API paths and workflow schemas vary by version; this card does not establish an executable task contract. Writing to target sites requires authorization for the specific action.

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
- **Vision = slower and pricier per step** than DOM-based tools. Its edge is resilience to layout change, not speed/cost, don't use it where a stable selector script (playwright) or bulk crawler (crawl4ai) would do.
- **Heaviest to operate** of the domain's frameworks: a server + Docker, not a pip-install lib. Standing it up for a single extraction is over-engineering, reserve for recurring, redesign-prone workflows.
- **AGPL-3.0** is the strictest license in this shard, fine for internal/self-host research, a real constraint if you bundle it into a distributed product.
- Anti-bot: vision doesn't bypass Cloudflare/DataDome challenge walls, a CAPTCHA still blocks it. Pair with stealth (patchright/camoufox) or Bright Data ② if the target is hardened.
- Self-host throughput is bounded by your one browser fleet + LLM rate limits; add proxies for scale (software free, proxies are the hidden cost).

## Failure signals & fallback
Failed = task stuck/timing out, CAPTCHA wall, or wrong fields filled (vision misread). Fallbacks: **playwright MCP / stagehand** for selector-precise control, **browser-use** for lighter NL goals, **crawl4ai** for bulk extraction, **Bright Data ②** when the barrier is anti-bot.
