# Tool: wigolo (local-first search + fetch + crawl + extract over one MCP)

- **Domain(s):** web-scraping (also: browser-automation)
- **Barrier route:** ③/④ · **Source tier:** L2 · **Ready MCP:** **yes**, the project *is* an MCP server (also REST + SDK); listed in the official MCP registry as `io.github.KnockOutEZ/wigolo`
- **Cost:** free, open-source, **no API key and no per-query bill** for the core tools (search, fetch, crawl, extract, cache, find-similar). Reranker and embeddings run on-device; everything stays under `~/.wigolo/`
- **Repo / Provider:** github.com/KnockOutEZ/wigolo, `KnockOutEZ/wigolo (5.1k★, gh-api 2026-09-06)`, not archived, pushed 2026-09-06, created 2026-04-12, 411 forks / 21 watchers / 60 open issues. **AGPL-3.0** (the gh API reports `NOASSERTION` because the LICENSE file opens with a project header, but the body reads "GNU Affero General Public License version 3", verified in the LICENSE blob 2026-09-06)
- **Top pick for its domain:** no. Bright Data ② remains the barrier-breaker and Tavily/Exa ② remain the search picks for hard/managed work; wigolo is the shard's first **free, keyless search** row

## What it does / when to pick it
One MCP surface for the whole read-the-web loop: **search, fetch, crawl, extract, cache, find-similar, research** and autonomous gather loops. Search fans one call out across **18 engine adapters in parallel**, fuses the rankings, then reranks on-device, with a SearXNG fallback behind it. Fetching escalates HTTP → headless only when a page needs it.

**Decision rule:** reach for wigolo when you want a search layer that costs nothing per query and needs no key, especially for high-volume or exploratory querying where Tavily's free tier (1,000 credits/mo) runs out mid-task. Keep **Tavily/Exa ②** where you want a managed SLA or their specific ranking, and go to **Bright Data ②** the moment the target is a real anti-bot wall (see below, wigolo labels those rather than solving them).

## Install
```bash
npx wigolo init --agents=claude-code     # unattended by default, safe in scripts/CI
wigolo doctor                            # per-component health report
```
Also on Docker Hub as `towhid69420/wigolo` (`:full` preinstalls the browser engine; the slim image lazy-loads models into the volume). An 11-pack agent-skill catalog is installed by `init` and managed with `wigolo skills add|list|remove`.

⚠ **The npm channel lags the repo.** npm `wigolo` is pinned at **0.2.1, published 2026-07-19** (registry checked 2026-09-06) while the repo was pushed 2026-09-06 — roughly seven weeks of drift. If you need a recent fix, install from source rather than npm.

## Auth / keys
None for the core tools, which is the whole point of the row. No account, no API key, no cloud round-trip. Optional keys only buy optional engines. The one credential you may add is a proxy (below), and that is opt-in.

## Usage, call examples
After `init`, the tools appear to the agent directly (`search`, `fetch`, `crawl`, `extract`, `find_similar`, `research`). Every response carries per-result scoring, and weak results are flagged as junk by wigolo's own scorer rather than passed through silently. Full per-tool response contracts live in the repo's `docs/tools.md`.

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
> Not yet exercised in a live market-intel run. The notes below come from the repo's own README/LICENSE and the npm registry, all fetched 2026-09-06; harden them with a `live-runs.jsonl` entry after first real use (R4).
- **It labels barriers, it does not break them.** When a bot-protected page can't be read you get a `blocked_by_challenge` failure rather than a challenge shell returned as content (README §116). That honesty is a feature — but it means **Cloudflare/DataDome targets still belong to Bright Data ②**. The shard's 2026-06 real-run lesson (Amazon returns HTTP 500 to firecrawl/WebFetch) is exactly the class wigolo will label.
- **IP reputation is still yours.** The README warns self-hosters plainly: challenge-protected sites score IP reputation, so a datacenter IP won't clear a wall a home connection would. Same ④ split as patchright/Scrapling — these tools fix the client, not your address. The opt-in proxy answer is in the repo's self-hosting guide.
- **Public beta, one maintainer.** Contribution is ~98% single-author and there are 60 open issues against 5.1k★. Treat it as promising infrastructure you can read, not as something with an SLA.
- **The crawl/fetch half overlaps crawl4ai ③.** The genuinely non-duplicative part is the free search layer; don't add both to a pipeline just to have them.

## Failure signals & fallback
Failure looks like `blocked_by_challenge` on the target, engines reported as failed in the response, or results the scorer flags as junk. **Escalation ladder:** (1) add a residential proxy per the self-hosting guide if the wall is IP-reputation based; (2) for a page that is barrier-blocked rather than merely JS-heavy, hand it to **Bright Data Web Unlocker** (②, free 5k/mo, no card), which absorbs fingerprint *and* IP; (3) for stealth self-host scraping specifically, **Scrapling** (③④) actually solves Turnstile/Interstitial where wigolo labels it; (4) if you need a managed search SLA or a specific ranking, fall back to **Tavily/Exa ②**.
