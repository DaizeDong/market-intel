# Tool: pricebuddy (self-host multi-store price tracker)

- **Domain(s):** ecommerce-arbitrage (also: consumer-price-compare)
- **Barrier route:** ④ self-host · **Source tier:** L2 · **Ready MCP:** no — self-hosted web app (Laravel/PHP + Docker), driven via its own UI/API, not an MCP.
- **Cost:** free, open-source (self-host; you supply the server) [github.com/jez500/pricebuddy, gh-api fetched 2026-07-01]
- **Repo / Provider:** `jez500/pricebuddy (978★, gh-api 2026-07-01)` — not archived, pushed 2026-06-30, ~55 forks, 8 contributors, active releases (v1.0.51, 2026-06-20). Healthy activity/adoption profile.
- **Top pick for its domain:** ④ self-host route top pick (replaces Cybrarist/Discount-Bandit as of the 2026-07 sweep — beats it on stars, contributor count, and release cadence). The domain's *overall* top pick is still **Keepa ①** for price history; pricebuddy is the free self-built-tracker option.

## What it does / when to pick it
A self-hosted price tracker: add product URLs across multiple stores (Amazon/eBay/AliExpress and generic sites), it scrapes prices on a schedule, charts history **from your deploy day forward**, and alerts on drops. **Decision rule:** when you want a free, self-owned "poor man's Keepa" and can run a container, pick pricebuddy — it's the most active OSS tracker in this niche (2026-07). Its hard limit vs Keepa is identical to the whole ④ route: **it cannot backfill historical price/BSR** — history only accrues from when you start recording. For years of past price/BSR curves, Keepa ① remains irreplaceable.

## Install
Docker Compose is the documented path: clone `jez500/pricebuddy`, configure the `.env` (DB + app URL), `docker compose up -d`. Needs a host to run on (VPS/home server) and, at scale, proxies for the store scrapes (same ④ hidden cost as any self-host scraper). Volatile install line: `pricing-install.md` → ecommerce-arbitrage.

## Auth / keys
No third-party API key for the core tracker. You create a local admin login on first run. Any store that needs a logged-in session (or throws anti-bot) needs the usual proxy/cookie handling — keep any such secrets in `secrets/`, not in the committed compose file.

## Usage — call examples
Web UI: add a product by URL, set the stores/frequency, view the price-history chart, configure drop alerts (email/notification). It exposes a JSON API for its own data; there is no prebuilt MCP, so agent use = drive the API or read its DB.

## General experience & gotchas (踩坑)
> Landed 2026-07 from a `live-runs.jsonl` price_mismatch signal (2026-06-15: pricebuddy 962★ then, outranked the shard's OSS picks); gh-api re-verified 978★ 2026-07-01. Not yet run in a live market-intel sweep — harden after first use (R4).
- **No historical backfill:** like all ④ trackers, it records from deploy day; it is not a substitute for Keepa's multi-year history. Pick it for *forward* tracking, not *retro* analysis.
- **You run the scrapers:** prices are only as fresh/complete as your instance's scrape schedule + how well the target store tolerates it. Hard anti-bot stores (Amazon at scale) may need proxies; a bare home-IP deploy will get rate-limited.
- **Self-host ops cost:** it's a real web app (DB, cron, container) — budget the maintenance, unlike a hosted MCP.

## Failure signals & fallback
Failure looks like stale/blank price points (store blocked the scrape), or the scheduler not firing. **Fallback:** (1) add a proxy for the blocked store; (2) for live one-off prices, **playwright MCP** (④) or **Bright Data** (②); (3) for multi-year history that no ④ tool can backfill, **Keepa** (①). Secondary OSS tracker if pricebuddy doesn't fit your stack: **Cybrarist/Discount-Bandit** (708★, still active) — now the #2 ④ pick.
