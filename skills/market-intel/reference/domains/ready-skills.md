# Domain: ready-skills

**Triage signals:** "is there a ready-made skill/plugin for marketing/SEO/content/research", don't
want to assemble MCPs from scratch, 现成的营销/调研 skill.

> Ecosystem reality: marketing / SEO / content / research skills are abundant and install-and-go.
> Business-ops深度 and arbitrage/making-money are scarce, still need MCP assembly + custom logic.

**Default pick:** Marketing/competitor/content → coreyhaines31/marketingskills (装了即用). SEO →
claude-seo. Packaged market-research pipeline → ishwarjha. Academic pipeline → academic-research-skills.
GTM/sales → gtm-agents. Mobile App Store Optimization → aso-skills. Discovery →
**sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills** (replaces less-maintained ComposioHQ catalog).
**Consumer shopping price compare → shopping-aggregator** (the consumer-side specialization;
market-intel itself handles seller-side ecommerce-arbitrage, see `ecommerce-arbitrage.md`).

**Judgment:** marketing/SEO/content/research = rich, install直用; consumer shopping was a gap
**until 2026-06** (no native SKILL.md existed; bundles all targeted seller/marketing tools),
shopping-aggregator was authored to fill exactly that gap. business-ops深度 + seller-side
arbitrage = still scarce, still assemble MCPs. Every skill's ceiling = which data MCPs you
connect, the skill is a shell; the work moved to MCP wiring + auth.

**Install guidance:** these are skills/plugins, not MCPs, install via the get-column commands.
