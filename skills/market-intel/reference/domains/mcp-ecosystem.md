# Domain: mcp-ecosystem (meta-domain, discovery surfaces only)

**Triage signals:** this shard is **never** the answer to a user's research query. It exists so
that the weekly/monthly refresh sweep knows **where new MCP servers come from**, and the other
15 real domain shards can incorporate what this shard surfaces. If a user asks "what MCPs are
new this week" you may route here directly; otherwise the only consumer is `refresh-protocol.md`
Discovery phase D1 (surfaces A + B + C).

**Why a meta-domain.** The MCP catalog turnover is sub-week. Pulling discovery sources into every
single domain shard would duplicate them 15×. One shard, polled on the weekly cadence, lets each
domain shard stay focused on its own data territory and trust that "new MCP fan-out" is handled
upstream. Verified 2026-06.

## Tier 1, authoritative registries (poll weekly)

| surface | URL | what to poll | signal-to-noise | cadence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MCP official registry** | `registry.modelcontextprotocol.io` (UI: `anthropic.modelcontextprotocol.io/registry`) | REST `/v0/servers?since=<iso>` for incremental delta; falls back to full list | **high** (authoritative, but coverage lags 3rd-party catalogs by ~weeks); `since=` works as of 2026-06, confirmed via curl | weekly |
| **PulseMCP** | `pulsemcp.com` + RSS `pulsemcp.com/feed` | weekly newsletter (Sunday) + "Newest" sort on catalog + RSS for releases | **highest**, most curated 3rd-party index; one human pass already done; categorized; tracks dead/forked servers | weekly (newsletter); RSS continuously |
| **Glama.ai MCP** | `glama.ai/mcp/servers` | quality-score sort + weekly digest email + `/mcp/servers?sort=created` | **high**, own quality scoring (security/license/maintenance heuristic); fewer junk listings than mcp.so | weekly |
| **Smithery.ai** | `smithery.ai` | "trending" + "newest" + install-count sort; CLI: `npx @smithery/cli list` | **medium-high**, install-count is real signal but inflatable; great cross-IDE install surface (Claude/Cursor/Cline/Windsurf one-click) | weekly |
| **mcp.so** | `mcp.so` | category browse + new listings | **medium-low**, widest catch, most noise; many dead/stub listings; use only when 上面 4 个都miss了 | monthly |
| **Apify MCP store** | `mcp.apify.com` + `apify.com/store` | actor count + run-volume + maintainer | **medium-high**, actors carry real run counts and pricing → harder采用度 signal | monthly |
| **GitHub MCP Registry** | `github.com/mcp` (NOT a repo, GitHub's official MCP discovery page launched 2025-09-16) | catalog browse + filter by category; aggregates ~100 community MCP servers (Figma, Postman, Stripe, Supabase, etc.) | **high**, GitHub-curated non-Anthropic discovery surface; official | weekly |
| **ChatGPT Apps Directory** | `chatgpt.com/apps` (anti-bot 403s WebFetch; OpenAI Apps SDK / MCP integrations) | ~979 apps as of 2026-06; MCP-based; browse + search | **high**, OpenAI counterpart to GitHub MCP Registry; captures non-Anthropic MCP momentum the Anthropic-only sweep would miss | weekly (manual, anti-bot) |

## Tier 2, GitHub velocity (poll weekly via gh-api)

| surface | query | signal-to-noise |
|---|---|---|
| **topic:mcp-server** | `gh search repos --topic mcp-server --sort updated --limit 50` + `--sort stars` | **medium**, broad; filter `pushed:>last_verified` + stars ≥ N to cut noise |
| **anthropic/modelcontextprotocol org** | `gh api orgs/modelcontextprotocol/repos`; also watch `modelcontextprotocol/servers` (87.3k★) reference list | **high**, official reference servers + spec changes land here first |
| **awesome-mcp-servers** | `punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers` (89.3k★), diff README between sweeps | **high**, human-curated, broken into domain sections; diff = newly-curated entries |
| **new-repo velocity** | `gh search repos "mcp server" created:>YYYY-MM-DD sort:stars` | **medium-high** for "new + already starred"; check star-curve for inflation |
| **fork networks of top picks** | for each existing top-pick MCP, check forks + "used by" + releases | **high**, surfaces more-active forks, upstream-deprecated, dependents adopting alternatives |

Anti-inflation: any new repo with stars-but-zero-issues-zero-forks or contributors concentrated on
one new account → demote to `WATCH`, do not promote across to a real domain shard.

## Tier 3, community + IDE markets (poll monthly, manual)

| surface | what to poll | signal-to-noise |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP Discord** (Anthropic-run) | `#mcp-showcase` channel (new submissions), `#mcp-general` for adoption chatter; invite via modelcontextprotocol.io | **high**, devs ship + announce here first; live debug of broken servers; **manual only** (no API; export via discord-history-export skill if needed) |
| **Cline marketplace** | `cline.bot` MCP marketplace section + Cline GitHub releases | **medium**, Cline ships an in-IDE MCP browser; what's featured = curated adoption signal |
| **Cursor MCP directory** | `cursor.com/directory` + Cursor's MCP page | **medium**, Cursor's "Featured" + "Popular" tabs; install-count visible |
| **Continue.dev hub** | `hub.continue.dev` (blocks + assistants now wrap MCPs) | **medium**, assistant configs reveal which MCPs Continue users actually stack |
| **Cody / Sourcegraph** | `sourcegraph.com/cody` extension listings; OpenCtx providers (Cody's pre-MCP equivalent, partly migrating to MCP) | **medium-low**, slower MCP uptake than Cline/Cursor; useful for code-context MCPs |
| **Hacker News** | Algolia HN search `mcp server`, `model context protocol`; comments only | **high for go-by-go reality check**, HN comments call out vaporware/套壳 fast |
| **Reddit** | `r/ClaudeAI`, `r/mcp`, `r/LocalLLaMA` "MCP" filter; monthly digest threads | **medium**, real-use feedback; filter营销号 by reading comments not OPs |
| **Anthropic Skills + Plugins** | `claude.ai` Skills marketplace + plugin marketplace (Claude Code) | **high**, orthogonal to MCP but overlapping discovery surface for "ready-to-use capability"; tracked separately in `domains/ready-skills.md` |

## Polling recipe (weekly light pass, used by Discovery D1 surfaces A + B + C)

1. Pull **MCP official registry** delta via `since=<last_verified>`; dedupe.
2. Pull **PulseMCP** RSS + newsletter; cross-ref with (1).
3. Pull **Glama.ai** `?sort=created` (or digest email); cross-ref.
4. Pull **Smithery** trending + newest; cross-ref.
5. `gh search repos --topic mcp-server pushed:>YYYY-MM-DD --sort stars --limit 50` + diff against last sweep's seen-set.
6. Diff `punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers` README HEAD vs last sweep.
7. Manual: scroll Discord `#mcp-showcase` since last poll (no API).
8. Output: one consolidated candidate list, dedup by repo URL, each with `discovery_surface` tag.
9. Drop candidates into `volatile/discovery-state.md` inbox; defer Verify & Diff to the monthly sweep per refresh-protocol §Cadence.

## Decision rule, when does an entry from here get promoted to a real domain shard

A candidate from this meta-domain is **never directly written** into a real domain shard. Promotion requires:

1. **Domain fit unambiguous**, the candidate's data territory maps cleanly to exactly one of the 15 existing domain shards (or one of the 6 placeholder future-domains in the horizon-scan watchlist). Cross-domain MCPs (e.g. "search + scrape + LLM") get filed under the **dominant** capability; auxiliary capabilities are noted in the row's `note` column.
2. **Discovery quality threshold passed**, must satisfy `refresh-protocol.md` D3 gates: activity ≥1, barrier-route ≥1, at least one independent 3rd-party adoption signal (HN/Reddit/dependents/install-count). New-but-unadopted → stays in `discovery-state.md` watchlist, NOT promoted.
3. **Comparative verdict vs. existing top pick**, ADD / REPLACE / WATCH / SKIP must be filled, per D5. Naked "new MCP exists" is not promotion-worthy.
4. **Verified against gh-api / official site**, star count, last-commit, and any pricing claim re-checked against L1 sources per defense protocol step 2. No memory-based numbers.
5. **No domain match → horizon-scan path**: if a candidate represents a new **territory** none of the 15 shards covers (e.g. a new agent-memory MCP category, a new modality), it is NOT promoted to an existing shard. Instead it goes into `horizon-scan` H2 with FOLD / NEW-DOMAIN / NEW-SKILL verdict, see refresh-protocol H1 to H4.

Mechanical implication: this shard is **read by** Discovery D1.A + D1.B + D1.C subagents; it is **written to** only when a new discovery surface appears (e.g. a new IDE ships an MCP marketplace, or a new registry launches). It is **never updated** based on individual MCP discoveries, those flow downstream to the matching real shard.

## What this shard explicitly does NOT track

- Individual MCP servers themselves, those live in the relevant domain shard's table.
- MCP protocol spec changes, those go in `CHANGELOG.md` if they affect tooling layer, else ignored.
- LLM/agent frameworks that *consume* MCPs (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline), those are install surfaces, tracked above only as discovery channels, not as research-data sources.
- Anthropic Skills (orthogonal capability layer), separate shard `domains/ready-skills.md`.

**Install guidance:** no installable artifact for this shard, it is a pure discovery surface registry. Per-MCP install guidance lives in `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md` under the relevant domain.
