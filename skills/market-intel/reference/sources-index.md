# Commercial source index (thin)

One line per domain. At triage, match the topic to 1–N domains, then read ONLY the matched
shard(s) in `domains/`. Do not read shards you didn't match.

### Meta-domains — NOT for triage (read by refresh-protocol Discovery only)

These are infrastructure shards, not research targets. Triage logic MUST NOT route a user's
research query here — they describe **where new tools come from**, not what data a topic needs.
Listed for refresh-protocol Discovery D1 to consume.

| meta-domain | purpose | shard |
|---|---|---|
| [mcp-ecosystem](domains/mcp-ecosystem.md) | where MCPs come from (registries, GitHub topic velocity, IDE markets, MCP Discord) — read by every Discovery sweep | `domains/mcp-ecosystem.md` |

### Reserved placeholders (v0.18.1) — domains the audit predicts will materialize in 2026-2027

These rows are intentional vacancies. Refresh's Horizon scan checks each at every quarterly
sweep — when the field crosses a maturity threshold (≥3 viable tools across ≥2 tiers), the
placeholder is populated into a real shard. Reasoning + triggers in `ROADMAP.md` "Future
domain placeholders".

| domain | triage signals | status |
|---|---|---|
| `agent-marketplace` | "what skills/agents are on Anthropic Hub / OpenAI GPT Store / Smithery" | reserved — populate when ≥3 tracked marketplaces have API surface |
| `ai-data-licensing` | "legally rent data instead of scraping" — datarade / Bright Data DaaS / Scale Data Engine | reserved — populate on 3rd D-PRICE event (also triggers `transport: brokerage`) |
| `voice-and-podcast-intel` | podcast/video transcript intel, podcast as research source | reserved — populate when Podscan-class tools >5 |
| `synthetic-and-evals` | synthetic dataset catalogs / Vals.ai / lmarena as research basis | reserved — populate when evals-as-research becomes routine |
| `regulatory-watch` | SEC 8-K / EU AI Act / state anti-scrape trackers, legal-tech MCPs | reserved — populate when EU AI Act detail rules land |
| `on-chain-intel-private` | TEE / zk privacy on-chain data (Chainlink Functions / Nillion / EigenLayer) | reserved — populate when privacy-data MCPs >3 |

Barrier-route legend (see each shard for detail):
① official API — compliant, often paid/limited, no ban risk
② resale API — provider absorbs the barrier, cheap pay-per-use, gray-area
③ self-host scrape (reverse-engineered API) — free, you supply accounts+proxies, ban risk
④ **browser automation / act-like-human** — real logged-in browser (playwright MCP + OSS repos);
   FIRST-CLASS, not last resort. Often **richer data** (rendered/logged-in view, fields APIs hide)
   at zero API cost. Cost = proxies at scale; most platform scraping violates ToS (ban risk).
   When a topic's official/resale source is paid or quota-capped, check route ④ before paying.
⑤ **agent-native browser** (reserved, see ROADMAP trigger) — Computer Use / Operator / Skyvern
   class. Currently flagged via `route_agent_native: true` in the registry; promoted to a default
   route when cost falls below ④ + residential-proxy aggregate. Not the default in 2026-06.

Death-code legend (`⚠ Avoid (dead, D-xxx)` tombstones): D-404 / D-TOS / D-PRICE / D-STALE
/ D-SUPERSEDED. **Canonical semantics + per-code action**: `refresh-protocol.md` §C4
(skill side) and `runbooks/sync-with-skill.md` §C (config side). Don't paraphrase here —
2026-06-17 cleanup confirmed it had drifted across 4 files.
