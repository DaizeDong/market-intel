# Research flow — how market-intel runs a task end-to-end

> **What this file is.** The canonical, fresh-agent runbook for a *single* market-intel research

> ledger." Read this when you are handed a commercial-research theme and want to know the order of
> operations and which real primitive to reach for at each step. It is the prose companion to
> `SKILL.md`'s Workflow section — `SKILL.md` is the authority; this file is the orientation.

> **Doctrine it obeys.** Root-cause design (`PHILOSOPHY.md`); the P5 seam (the query path here never
> imports a refresh/ops script — it uses only query-side signals); Side A/B/C (the availability gate

## 0. Startup — does this skill even apply?

Before anything, gate the request (`SKILL.md` "When to stop and delegate immediately"):

- Single-fact lookup → plain web search, do not invoke this workflow.
- General web-only deep report (no specialized commercial source) → delegate to `deep-research`, exit.
- Academic / scientific literature → delegate to `research-lit`, exit.
- **Needs a specialized commercial source** (X data, real prices, market/finance, on-chain, SEO,
  social, leads) → continue. This is the only case where market-intel earns its keep.

## 1. Theme intake

State the theme in one line and extract its decision question: what would the user *do* with the
answer (buy/sell/build/avoid)? That intent sets which claims are "decision-grade" (→ the ≥2
independent-source bar in the guardrails) and how aggressive the disconfirmation search must be.

## 2. Triage → domains

Read `reference/sources-index.md` (thin, ~12 lines). Match the theme to 1–N **real** commercial
domains. **Do not** read full domain shards yet. **Skip meta-domains** (`mcp-ecosystem`) — they are
refresh-sweep infrastructure, never a research route. Zero domain matches → not in scope; route to
plain web search.

## 3. Pick the invocation SCALE (the dial)

The single biggest failure mode is **under-calling**. Pick a tier explicitly from the SCALE dial in
`SKILL.md` Step 1:

- `scan` — 1 top domain, 1 top tool, fixed stop (quick scoped check).
- `standard` — routed domains, 2–3 tools each, fixed stop.
- `deep` — **default for any genuine research / "comprehensive / 全面"** — all relevant domains, ALL
  available tools per domain, 3+ angles, cross-checked to ≥2 independent sources.
- `exhaustive` — all relevant, no omission, multi-angle until **saturation** (new calls add no new
  facts).

When in doubt, default to `deep`, not `standard`. Honor the **three iron rules** (no sampling;
saturate don't fixed-stop; report coverage) and the **~40 call / ~6 round cost ceiling** — exceeding
it is a stated choice, and the uncovered remainder becomes an explicit gap, never a silent truncate.
A numeric override (`{domains, tools_per_domain, queries_per_tool, stop}`) wins if the user gives one.

## 4. Detect + availability-gate (the task-time classifier)

Run `claude mcp list` and parse the three-state health output — a source is usable only if it shows
`✓ Connected`; treat `✗ Failed` / `! Needs authentication` as not available. Tool-name prefix
matching is a cross-check only, never the primary signal (`SKILL.md` Step 2). Then check whether a
**companion config repo** exists (discovery order: `$MARKET_INTEL_CONFIG` → `~/.market-intel-config/`
→ `~/.config/market-intel-config/`; spec: `reference/companion-config-spec.md`). If present, read its
`registry.json` for `installed` / `tier` / `transport` / `mcp_server_name` / `health_last` — that is
the authoritative "what the user has." Never read `secrets/<slug>.env`.

Now run **Step 2b** — for the triaged domains' relevant tools, classify each **at this moment** into
one of three buckets using **query-side signals only** (no refresh/ops-script import — stay
P5-clean):

| bucket | signal | action |
|---|---|---|
| **available-now** | `✓ Connected`, or keyless/no-auth, or local lib installed, or companion `installed:true` + `mcp_server_name` Connected | fan out at SCALE (step 5) |
| **configurable-with-setup** | not live now, but a free/cheap recipe exists (companion has it un-applied, or `activation-recipes.md` lists a free-key/free-tier/install-no-key path) | JIT-suggest in report (step 6); do NOT call this turn |
| **hard-gap** | only paid/enterprise unlocks it, or tombstoned (`D-404`/`D-PRICE`/`D-TOS`/dead) | explicit gap; suggest only if theme truly needs the paid depth, flagged paid |

Live state wins for *can-I-call-it-now*; companion tier informs *is-it-free-to-activate*. This is
warn-level (Side A/B/C) — it shapes fan-out and recommendations, it never refuses to run.

## 5. Fan out to available-now tools — at scale

Hand the **available-now** sources + sub-questions to the heavy harness (`SKILL.md` Step 4): one
subagent per sub-question via the Agent tool (each told to load its target MCP via ToolSearch
first — subagents inherit MCPs only in deferred form), or `deep-research` for the web portion, or
`research-lit`'s `— sources:` detect-or-skip routing for source-routed retrieval. Prefer the free
browser-automation route (④, playwright already connected) over paid APIs when it fits; reach for
paid ①/② only for history the browser can't backfill, scale reliability, or compliance.

Every subagent returns a **structured evidence unit**, not prose:
`{ status, claims:[{claim, source_url, quote, source_tier, date, confidence}], coverage_notes }`,
length-capped per field. The main agent reduces units — it never reads raw page dumps. Fan-out >5 →
insert a combiner layer (each merges 3–4 workers) so the main context never holds N long reports.

## 6. JIT-surface config gaps for the rest (theme-driven, at task-time)

For every `configurable-with-setup` (and any theme-critical `hard-gap`) tool: **do not silently
skip**. Emit a one-line, theme-specific suggestion naming what the missing tool would deepen, its
cost class, and the exact activation path (from `reference/activation-recipes.md`):

> "To deepen **<this theme aspect>**, configure **<tool>** (<free-key | free-tier | install-no-key |
> paid $X>) — `python tools/console.py connect <slug>` (canonical, resolves by slug), or see
> `reference/activation-recipes.md` for the key source; then `/mcp` reconnect (won't help this turn)."

Configuration is recommended **at task-time, driven by the theme** — not pre-done. These lines feed
the report's Coverage-gaps → "Configure for deeper data" block (`reference/report-template.md`).

## 7. Adversarial verify (guardrails, during synthesis)

Apply the HARD guardrails in `SKILL.md` "Quality guardrails":

1. **Citation gate** — an independent verifier fetches each cited URL and confirms the verbatim
   value before it enters the report (`✓verified / ⚠unverifiable / ✗dead`; drop dead).
2. **≥2 independent sources** for decision-grade claims (wire-service reprints = one source).
3. **Source tiers** L1–L5; vendor self-claims (L3) can't be sole support for performance/profit.
4. **No silent degradation** — fallback from a barrier source is labeled in-section.
5. **Timestamp volatile data** — every price/rate/ranking carries `[fetched | published]`.
6. **Disconfirmation mandate** — a dedicated reverse-search subagent (scam/failure/loss/banned/
   expired/risk/regulation); report has a "Risks & counter-evidence" section (+ execution friction
   for arbitrage).
7. **Surface conflicts, don't average** — disagreement matrix, mark `confirmed/disputed/unresolved`.
8. **Failures become explicit gaps** — `failed/empty` → one rewrite+retry → else list under "Not
   covered."

## 8. Synthesize with the coverage report

Write per `reference/report-template.md`: snapshot date, executive summary (confidence-tagged),
findings by domain (tiered + dated + corroborated), cross-verification verdicts, disagreement
matrix, risks & counter-evidence, then the **Coverage-gaps** ledger — which makes "comprehensive"
*verifiable, not asserted*:

- tool coverage `invoked N / M available-now in scope` per domain + total, at the chosen SCALE;
- the **availability-gate classification** for this run (available-now / configurable-with-setup /
  hard-gap);
- uncovered tools as explicit gaps (reason each);
- the JIT theme-tied "configure for deeper data" suggestions from step 6;
- full source list with tiers + dates.

## 9. Close the loop (optional, cheap)

Append one line per source actually touched to the live-run ledger (reuses guardrail verdicts;
near-zero extra cost). This is the highest-value error signal for the next refresh sweep — a source
flagged `dead` in real use auto-nominates for the deletion path.

The ledger lives OUTSIDE this repo — `~/.market-intel-config/data/metrics/live-runs.jsonl`, resolved
by `tools/datadir.py` — because an entry records what you were actually researching. If the data dir
does not exist, note the observations in the reply so they aren't lost; never write them into the
repo. Shape: `metrics/live-runs.jsonl.example`.
